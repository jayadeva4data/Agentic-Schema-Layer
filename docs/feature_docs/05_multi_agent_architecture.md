## Background / Context

A modular, agent-based architecture is essential for extensibility and maintainability. The SemanticLayerAgent and its sub-agents will coordinate schema understanding, query translation, execution, and context management.

## Objective

Implement the SemanticLayerAgent class and its sub-agents (Schema, Query, Execution, Context). Define clear interfaces and message-passing protocols between agents.

**Expanded Objective (Agentic Systems):**
- Support agentic workflows for automated schema introspection, dbt model generation, macro/documentation/test generation, and value sampling/clarification.

## Scope

Included:
- Implementation of SemanticLayerAgent and sub-agents
- Definition of agent interfaces
- Message-passing protocols
- Unit and integration tests
- **Agentic systems for:**
  - Schema Introspector Agent (connects to DB, extracts schema)
  - dbt Model Generator Agent (writes dbt model and schema files)
  - Macro Generator Agent (creates reusable macros)
  - Documentation Agent (generates docs from schema/comments)
  - Test Generator Agent (creates dbt tests)
  - Value Sampling Agent (profiles column values for LLM prompts)
  - Clarification/Feedback Agent (handles ambiguous queries, user feedback)
  - NL-to-SQL Agent (converts NL to SQL using schema context)
  - Embedding Agent (embeds schema for semantic search)
  - Orchestrator Agent (coordinates agent workflow)

Excluded:
- Full query planning and routing logic
- Downstream feature integration

## Functional Requirements

- Implement SemanticLayerAgent class
- Implement SchemaIntelligenceAgent, QueryTranslationAgent, ExecutionOrchestrator, ContextManager
- Define interfaces for agent communication
- All logic must be tested
- **Agentic extensions:**
  - Agents must be able to run independently or as part of orchestrated workflows
  - Agents must support plug-and-play extension for new agent types

## Non-Functional Requirements (if any)

- Code must be modular and extensible
- All agents must be independently testable

## Acceptance Criteria

- Agents are implemented and communicate via defined interfaces
- Agentic workflows for schema introspection, dbt generation, value sampling, and clarification are demonstrated
- All tests pass

## Dependencies / Impact

- Previous foundational setup

## Additional Notes

This architecture will support all future agentic workflows, including automated dbt project bootstrapping, value-aware NL-to-SQL, and interactive clarification.
