## Background / Context

A modular, agent-based architecture is essential for extensibility and maintainability. The SemanticLayerAgent and its sub-agents will coordinate schema understanding, query translation, execution, and context management.

## Objective

Implement the SemanticLayerAgent class and its sub-agents (Schema, Query, Execution, Context). Define clear interfaces and message-passing protocols between agents.

## Scope

Included:
- Implementation of SemanticLayerAgent and sub-agents
- Definition of agent interfaces
- Message-passing protocols
- Unit and integration tests

Excluded:
- Full query planning and routing logic
- Downstream feature integration

## Functional Requirements

- Implement SemanticLayerAgent class
- Implement SchemaIntelligenceAgent, QueryTranslationAgent, ExecutionOrchestrator, ContextManager
- Define interfaces for agent communication
- All logic must be tested

## Non-Functional Requirements (if any)

- Code must be modular and extensible
- All agents must be independently testable

## Acceptance Criteria

- Agents are implemented and communicate via defined interfaces
- All tests pass

## Dependencies / Impact

- Previous foundational setup

## Additional Notes

This architecture will support all future agentic workflows.
