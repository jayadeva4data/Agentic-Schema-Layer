## Background / Context

Efficient query planning and routing are critical for performance and correctness. The system must route queries to the appropriate agent and support multiple data sources.

## Objective

Implement logic to plan and route queries to the correct agent/component, with support for multiple data sources (Postgres, Snowflake).

## Scope

Included:
- Query planning logic
- Routing to correct agent/component
- Support for multiple data sources
- Unit and integration tests

Excluded:
- Full execution orchestration
- Advanced optimization

## Functional Requirements

- Plan and route queries based on type and context
- Support routing to Postgres and Snowflake
- All logic must be tested

## Non-Functional Requirements (if any)

- Routing must be performant
- Code must be modular and testable

## Acceptance Criteria

- Queries are routed correctly in sample scenarios
- All tests pass

## Dependencies / Impact

- Multi-agent architecture
- Data source configurations

## Additional Notes

This is a prerequisite for execution orchestration and optimization.
