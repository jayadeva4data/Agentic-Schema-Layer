## Background / Context

As part of the agentic data pipeline, there is a need to automate data cleansing (e.g., handling missing values, deduplication, normalization) in a modular, reproducible, and dbt-native way. This will ensure that raw ingested data is standardized and ready for downstream modeling and analytics, while leveraging dbt's versioning and documentation capabilities.

## Objective

Develop a Data Cleansing Agent that generates dbt model files to perform data cleansing on raw tables, supporting both rule-based and LLM-driven cleansing logic.

## Scope

**Included:**
- Agent class in `src/agents/` that generates dbt model SQL for cleansing
- Support for both rule-based and LLM-driven cleansing
- Output: new dbt model file (e.g., `table_clean.sql`) and optional YAML
- Integration with existing agentic pipeline

**Excluded:**
- Direct in-place mutation of raw tables
- UI for rule specification (CLI/agent only)

## Functional Requirements

- The agent must accept a raw table name and generate a dbt model for a cleaned version (e.g., `table_clean`).
- The agent must support both rule-based and LLM-driven cleansing, selectable via input.
- The agent must output the generated dbt model SQL and write it to the models directory.
- The agent must return a summary of cleansing actions taken.
- The agent must not overwrite existing dbt models unless explicitly allowed.

## Non-Functional Requirements (if any)

- The agent should produce human-readable, well-commented SQL.
- The agent should be modular and independently testable.
- The agent should follow project naming and documentation conventions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Given a raw table, the agent generates a new dbt model file for the cleaned table.
- [ ] The agent supports both rule-based and LLM-driven cleansing.
- [ ] The generated SQL is valid, runs in dbt, and produces the expected cleaned table.
- [ ] The agent returns a summary of cleansing actions.
- [ ] The agent is covered by tests and documentation.

## Dependencies / Impact

- Depends on dbt, existing agent base, and LLM integration (for LLM-driven mode).
- May impact dbt model directory and documentation.

## Additional Notes

- Consider extensibility for future cleansing rules or enrichment steps.
- Should be compatible with existing ingestion and modeling agents.
