## Background / Context

Optimizing query performance is essential for a responsive semantic layer. Tracking performance, implementing caching, and materializing results will improve user experience and system efficiency.

## Objective

Add query performance tracking, optimization logic, caching, and materialization strategies.

## Scope

Included:
- Query performance tracking
- Query optimization logic
- Caching and materialization
- Unit and integration tests

Excluded:
- Full execution orchestration
- Security features

## Functional Requirements

- Track and log query performance metrics
- Implement query optimization strategies
- Add caching and materialization for results
- All logic must be tested

## Non-Functional Requirements (if any)

- Optimization must not degrade correctness
- Code must be modular and testable

## Acceptance Criteria

- Query performance is tracked and reported
- Caching and materialization work as expected
- All tests pass

## Dependencies / Impact

- Execution orchestrator

## Additional Notes

This will improve system responsiveness and efficiency.
