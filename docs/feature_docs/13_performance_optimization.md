As the system matures, performance bottlenecks may arise. Profiling and optimizing API and agent performance is essential for a production-ready semantic layer.

## Objective

Profile and optimize API and agent performance.

## Scope

Included:
- Profiling of API and agent components
- Performance optimization
- Unit and integration tests

Excluded:
- Security and deployment automation

## Functional Requirements

- Profile API and agent performance
- Optimize identified bottlenecks
- All logic must be tested

## Non-Functional Requirements (if any)

- Optimizations must not degrade correctness
- Code must be modular and testable

## Acceptance Criteria

- Performance improvements are measurable in sample scenarios
- All tests pass

## Dependencies / Impact

- All system components

## Additional Notes

This will ensure the system is production-ready.
