## Background / Context

To establish a robust foundation for the semantic layer project, we need a well-structured Python environment, initial API skeleton, dbt project scaffolding, and vector database setup. This enables modular, testable, and scalable development from the outset.

## Objective

Set up the initial project structure, including virtual environment, FastAPI skeleton, dbt scaffolding, vector database integration, and a dedicated tests folder.

## Scope

Included:
- Python project structure
- Virtual environment (venv/)
- FastAPI skeleton
- dbt project scaffolding
- Vector DB (Chroma/Pinecone) setup
- Initial tests/ folder for all future tests

Excluded:
- Feature implementation
- CI/CD and containerization

## Functional Requirements

- Create a Python project structure with clear module separation
- Set up and document virtual environment activation (venv/)
- Add FastAPI skeleton with a health check endpoint
- Scaffold a dbt project with example model
- Integrate and document vector DB setup (Chroma or Pinecone)
- Create a tests/ folder with a sample test

## Non-Functional Requirements (if any)

- All code must be linted and formatted
- All setup steps must be documented in README

## Acceptance Criteria

- Project can be set up and run locally following README
- FastAPI health endpoint responds successfully
- dbt project compiles without errors
- Vector DB can be started and queried
- Sample test runs and passes

## Dependencies / Impact

- Python 3.9+
- dbt CLI
- Chroma or Pinecone vector DB

## Additional Notes

This is the foundation for all subsequent features. All future PRs will build on this structure.
