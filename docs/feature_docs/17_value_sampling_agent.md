## Background / Context

LLM-based NL-to-SQL systems need to be data-aware to robustly handle user queries involving value aliases, typos, or synonyms. Sampling representative values from database columns and providing them to the LLM can significantly improve query accuracy and user experience.

## Objective

Implement a Value Sampling Agent that profiles and caches representative values for relevant columns, making these available for prompt augmentation and downstream agents.

## Scope

Included:
- Connect to the database and sample values for specified columns (e.g., top N, most frequent, unique values).
- Cache sampled values for efficient reuse.
- Provide an interface for other agents to access sampled values.
- Unit and integration tests for sampling and caching logic.

Excluded:
- Full query execution and result retrieval.
- Downstream analytics or visualization.

## Functional Requirements

- Must connect to the target database and sample values for specified columns.
- Must support configurable sampling strategies (top N, most frequent, etc.).
- Must cache sampled values and refresh on demand.
- Must provide an API or internal interface for other agents to access sampled values.
- All logic must be tested.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Sampling must be efficient and not overload the database.
- Code must be modular, extensible, and testable.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Sampled values are available for relevant columns and can be used to augment LLM prompts.
- Sampling and caching logic is covered by tests.
- Other agents can access sampled values via a documented interface.

## Dependencies / Impact

- Database access
- Integration with NL-to-SQL and schema agents

## Additional Notes

This agent is foundational for robust, data-aware NL-to-SQL and will support future agents for alias mapping, fuzzy matching, and clarification.
